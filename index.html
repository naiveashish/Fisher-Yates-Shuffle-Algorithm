   <p><b>The Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm</b> is a method for randomly shuffling the elements of an array. It works by iterating over the array in reverse order, swapping each element with a randomly selected element that precedes it. This process ensures that every element has an equal chance of being placed at any position in the shuffled array.

Here's a detailed explanation of the algorithm:

Initialization: Start by initializing an array, points, with the elements to be shuffled.

Iteration: Begin a loop that iterates over the array in reverse order, from the last element to the second element. This loop is controlled by the variable i, which starts at points.length - 1 and decrements by 1 in each iteration until i becomes 1.

Random Selection: Within each iteration of the loop, generate a random index j between 0 and i, inclusive. This random index represents the position of an element to swap with the element at index i.

Swap Elements: Swap the element at index i with the element at index j. This ensures that each element has an equal chance of being placed at any position in the shuffled array.

Iteration Completes: Once the loop completes, the array points will be shuffled, with its elements rearranged randomly.</p>
